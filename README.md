A custom Home Assistant integration for the [Renson Healthbox
3](https://renson.net/gd-gb/products/ventilation/healthbox), a whole-house
demand-controlled ventilation unit. It talks directly to the device over
your local network - no cloud account required.

This is **not** the same product as Home Assistant core's built-in `renson`
integration, which targets the unrelated Renson Endura Delta ventilation
unit and speaks a completely different API. This integration's domain is
`healthbox3` and does not conflict with it.

This is an unofficial, community-maintained integration, not affiliated
with or endorsed by Renson. The icon and logo shown for this integration
are Renson's own Healthbox 3 branding, used to identify the product this
integration connects to - not an indication of official support or
endorsement.

This integration is HACS-only for now. Submitting it to Home Assistant
core isn't planned by its maintainer - that path requires extracting
`api.py` into a standalone published PyPI package, a multi-PR core
review process, and an open-ended maintenance commitment as code owner,
which is beyond what's currently on offer here. If you're interested in
taking that on, please open a GitHub issue to discuss it.

## Features

- Per-room sensors for whichever of temperature, humidity, CO2, VOC and air
  quality index your device's hardware actually reports (varies by room).
  Each air quality index reading is paired with a qualification label
  (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Bad/Very bad), on Renson's own scale - both
  as a `qualification` attribute on the numeric sensor, and as a
  standalone `AQI level` sensor whose own state is that label, for a
  dashboard tile that reads "Good" at a glance instead of a raw number -
  see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) for two comparability
  caveats.
- A whole-house air quality index sensor, and a whole-house ventilation
  level sensor - only available with an activated API key (see below).
- A per-room airflow sensor, showing current airflow as a percentage of
  that room's rated (nominal) flow - not capped at 100%, since boost can
  push it well past nominal.
- A diagnostic firmware version sensor - a concrete signal that a
  firmware update happened, worth checking if anything undocumented
  starts behaving differently. Only available with an activated API key.
- Device-reported error/fault surfacing - each error the Healthbox itself
  reports (e.g. a sensor fault) creates a Home Assistant repair issue
  (**Settings > Repairs**) so it's not something you'd only notice by
  opening Renson's own app, plus a diagnostic sensor with the current
  error count for automations/history. Only available with an activated
  API key; see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) for how clearing
  works.
- A boost `fan` entity per room (plus one for all rooms at once), with
  percentage/preset controls and a real-level attribute - see
  [Boost control](#boost-control).
- A ventilation profile selector per room (eco/health/intense) - only
  available with an activated API key (see below).
- Automatic reauthentication prompt if your API key stops working, with a
  graceful fallback to basic (v1) functionality in the meantime rather than
  entities going unavailable.
- Automatic, silent reconnection if your Healthbox 3's IP address changes
  (e.g. a DHCP lease renewal) after setup - no notification, no action
  needed.
- A dashboard card drawing the unit and its outlets as Renson's own app
  does, with each room's readings on hover - see
  [Dashboard card](#dashboard-card). It comes with the integration; there
  is no resource to register and nothing to configure.
- Demand control, minimum ventilation level, Breeze's trigger temperature
  (temperature-triggered night cooling), per-room CO2 threshold, and
  silent schedule controls - all mirroring settings from Renson's own
  mobile app; only available with an activated API key (see below).

## Use cases

- **Whole-house air quality monitoring** - a dashboard built from the
  per-room temperature/humidity/CO2/VOC/AQI sensors, plus the whole-house
  air quality index sensor for an at-a-glance summary.
- **Targeted, humidity- or CO2-triggered boosting** - automatically boost
  a bathroom's extraction when its humidity sensor spikes, or a bedroom
  when CO2 climbs overnight, instead of relying on a fixed schedule or
  remembering to press boost manually (see [Examples](#examples)).
- **One-press "boost everywhere"** - the `Boost all` fan entity for
  situations like cooking with guests over, without needing to know which
  specific rooms need it.
- **Automated profile switching** - drive each room's eco/health/intense
  profile from presence or time-of-day automations (e.g. `health` during
  the day, `eco` overnight), rather than only through Renson's own app.

## Installation

### HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=TrojanHorsePower&repository=ha-healthbox3&category=integration)

Or manually:

1. In HACS, search for "Renson Healthbox 3" and install it (it's part
   of the default HACS store, no need to add a custom repository).
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/healthbox3` folder from this repository into
your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory, then restart
Home Assistant.

## Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=healthbox3)

Or manually: **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** →
search "Renson Healthbox 3".

1. **Device IP address.** The integration first tries to find your
   Healthbox 3 automatically via a UDP broadcast; if it finds one, confirm
   it, or pick from a list if it finds more than one. If nothing answers
   within a few seconds - broadcast discovery is unreliable on some
   networks, see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) - enter the IP
   address or hostname manually instead. Either way, the integration
   validates connectivity by calling the device's basic (v1) API before
   continuing; for a manually-entered IP, it also makes a best-effort
   unicast probe afterward to show a confirmation screen with the
   device's MAC address and firmware version. If that probe doesn't
   respond, setup continues straight on regardless - connectivity was
   already verified by the required HTTP call, so this is purely extra
   detail, never a requirement.
2. **API key (optional).** You can stop here and use the integration with
   basic functionality, or unlock full sensor data, profile control, and
   the demand control/minimum ventilation/Breeze/CO2 threshold/silent
   schedule entities - see below.

### Changing the IP address or API key later

If your Healthbox 3 gets a new IP (e.g. a DHCP reassignment), you usually
don't need to do anything: the integration reconnects on its own,
silently, with no action needed and no notification shown, via two
independent paths. Once it notices it can't reach the device anymore, it
actively searches the network for it; separately, Home Assistant's own
passive DHCP discovery also recognizes the device and can trigger the
same reconnect - including for an entry that's never connected
successfully even once, which the active search alone can't help with.
Neither is instant or guaranteed - see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

If it doesn't (or you'd rather fix it immediately instead of waiting),
use **Settings → Devices & Services → Renson Healthbox 3 → Reconfigure**.
It re-validates connectivity against the new address and confirms (by
serial number) that it's still the *same* device before updating anything
in place, so your existing entities, history, and automations keep
working. The API key field is left blank by default and only changed if
you type a new value - leaving it blank keeps whatever key is already
stored.

### Getting an API key (optional, but recommended)

Out of the box, the Healthbox 3's local API only exposes basic room/valve
data and lets you control boost - this doesn't require a key. To unlock
temperature, humidity, CO2, VOC, air quality, and ventilation level
sensors, ventilation profile control, and the demand control/minimum
ventilation/Breeze/CO2 threshold/silent schedule entities, you need an
API key from Renson:

1. Find your device's **serial number** and **warranty number**. Both are
   shown in the response of a basic API call to the device - if you're
   comfortable with `curl`:
   ```
   curl http://<device-ip>/v1/api/data/current
   ```
   Look for `"serial"` and `"warranty_number"` near the top of the response.
2. Contact Renson support and request a local API key for your device,
   giving them these two numbers.
3. When you receive the key, paste it into the "API key" field during setup
   (or via Reconfigure/Reauthenticate if you're adding it later), and the
   integration will activate it with the device and verify it before
   saving - if activation fails, you'll see an error and can retry.

**Already activated the key yourself** (e.g. by POSTing it to
`/v2/api/api_key` directly, per Renson's docs, before installing this
integration)? You don't need to paste it into the integration at all -
activation is a one-time change on the device itself, not something tied
to a particular client or session. Just leave the "API key" field blank;
the integration checks `/v2/api/api_key/status` on every startup regardless
of whether you gave it a key, so it will detect the already-active key and
enable full sensor/profile functionality automatically.

**Note:** Renson-issued API keys carry a multi-year expiry (e.g. a key
issued in 2026 might read `VALID_UNTIL: 20310706`). The device itself has
no local awareness of this expiry date - it isn't exposed anywhere in the
local API - so there's no way for this integration to warn you ahead of
time. If your profile-select entities and extra sensors quietly disappear
years from now and boost control keeps working, that's very likely an
expired key, not a bug; the integration will have already fallen back to
v1-only functionality and prompted you to reauthenticate with a new key.

### Devices and areas

A Healthbox is registered as **one device for the unit, plus one device per
ventilated room**, each linked back to the unit.

Anything describing the appliance as a whole stays on the unit device: the
whole-house air quality, ventilation level, power and fan readings, `Boost
all`, demand control, Silent and every diagnostic. Everything measured in
or applied to a single room lives on that room's device.

That split exists so **areas work**. Home Assistant assigns areas per
device, so with a single device the only way to get the kitchen's sensors
into the Kitchen area is to move them one by one - which also leaves their
entity IDs carrying whatever prefix they had at the time. One device per
room means one assignment per room, and every sensor in it follows.

It also keeps names short: a room sensor is just `Temperature`, since the
device already says which room. Rename the unit device in the UI if you'd
like something more specific than its reported description (e.g. "Basement
Healthbox"); room devices take the room names configured on the Healthbox
itself.

### Energy dashboard

The `Energy` sensor is cumulative kWh, ready to drop straight into Home
Assistant's **Energy dashboard** - no Riemann-sum helper to set up. That is
worth doing: the unit runs continuously, so even a handful of watts adds up
over a year.

**Settings > Dashboards > Energy > Individual devices > Add device**, and
pick the Healthbox `Energy` sensor.

It is integrated here from the whole-device `Power` reading, trapezoidally
between consecutive polls, and the running total survives restarts. Gaps
longer than 15 minutes are skipped rather than extrapolated: past that
point there is no way to tell "Home Assistant was down while the fan kept
running" from "the unit was off", and under-reporting beats inventing
energy that may never have been used.

`Power` (whole device) is what feeds it, not `Fan power`: the fan-only
figure leaves out the electronics' own draw and would under-report. On the
reference hardware the two read 6.2 W and 11.2 W at the same moment.

### Duct model

The device continuously calibrates a physical model of your ducting,
`Q = C x sqrt(dP)`, and this integration surfaces it: `<room> Duct
conductance` per room, plus `Outlet conductance` and `Network leakage` for
the network as a whole.

Conductance is a property of the duct itself - its length, diameter and
bends - so it stays put across profile and mode changes. That's what makes
it useful: a **sustained** downward drift in one room's conductance means
that duct or its valve is slowly fouling up, visible long before airflow
drops enough to notice.

Read it as a trend over weeks, not as a threshold. Individual readings are
noisy: recalibrating alone moves conductance by a few percent and pressure
by rather more, so a single step means nothing on its own.

### Boost control

Boost is modeled as a `fan` entity (per room, plus one "Boost all" for every
room at once) rather than a plain switch, since Home Assistant's fan
platform gets a proper more-info dialog and Tile card - a percentage slider
and a duration picker in one control, instead of three separate rows.

**Turning a boost fan off does not stop ventilation.** The Healthbox always
ventilates every room at a baseline rate determined by its eco/health/intense
profile (the `<room> Profile` select entity, unrelated to boost). "Off" on
a boost fan only means "boost cancelled - back to that normal profile-driven
rate," not "no airflow."

**The percentage slider is rescaled**, not the device's real numbers. The
Healthbox's actual boost level is 10-200% of a room's nominal flow rate, but
Home Assistant's fan platform hard-requires a plain 0-100% domain, so:
- 0% = boost off (`enable: false`) - ventilation continues at the profile rate
- 1-100% = boost on, linearly rescaled onto the device's real 10-200% range

The real, unscaled level (e.g. `"150%"`) is always shown as a `level`
attribute on the entity, so you can see what the device actually received
even though the slider itself reads a clean 0-100.

**Duration is a preset picker**, not exact minutes: `5 min`, `10 min`,
`15 min`, `30 min`, `45 min`, `1 hour`, `2 hours`, `4 hours` - a fixed list,
not an arbitrary custom duration (5 minutes is also the shortest boost
Renson's own app offers). Pick one from the fan's preset dropdown; it's
converted to the device's native seconds-based timeout at the boundary.

"Boost all" uses one shared percentage/preset applied to every room
simultaneously when triggered, matching Renson's own app - it is *not*
"trigger every room at its own settings."

**Confirmed on real hardware:** changing the percentage or preset while a
boost fan is already on does not adjust it smoothly in place - it restarts
the boost's countdown from the new full duration. For example: a boost with
279 seconds left, nudged to a new percentage, jumps back to a fresh 900
seconds (or whatever duration is currently set), not 279. This is a device
behavior, not a bug in this integration. Watch the `remaining` attribute
after adjusting the slider mid-boost and you'll see it jump back up - that's
expected. The integration logs an info-level message each time this happens
("Restarting active boost for room(s) ...").

## Dashboard card

The integration ships a Lovelace card that draws the unit and its outlets
the way Renson's own app does: a numbered connection at each collector
port that carries a room, a blanking cap everywhere else, and the unit
centred. Hovering (or clicking, or tabbing to) an outlet opens a panel
with that room's pictogram, name, Home Assistant area, regulatory code,
airflow percentage beside the outlet number, air quality, profile and
boost; clicking opens that room's more-info dialog.

Add it from the card picker - **Edit dashboard** → **Add card** → search
"Renson Healthbox". The integration serves the card itself, so there is
no resource to register by hand, and nothing about it is per-install: it
reads the real topology from the integration, so the same card works on
any unit and in any language.

**After installing or updating this integration, restart Home Assistant
and then hard-refresh your browser before looking for the card.** The
card and the room pictograms are registered with the frontend while the
integration sets up, and the browser only picks the new module up on a
fresh page load - so a card that is "missing" right after an update is
almost always a cached page rather than a failed install.

The only option is `serial`, and only if you have more than one Healthbox:

```yaml
type: custom:healthbox-card
serial: 1234567890   # optional; defaults to the first unit configured
```

Outlets split into several branches are drawn with Renson's dotted
numbering (`1.1`, `1.2`) as a chain running away from the unit, the way
the Renson installer app draws them. An outlet is marked faulty only when
a reported error's association id is exactly one of this unit's port
numbers - `/v1/error` says nothing about what that id identifies, so
anything else is shown against the unit rather than blamed on a room.

## Examples

Entity IDs below assume the device's default name ("Healthbox 3.0" -
adjust the `healthbox_3_0` prefix if you've renamed the device or its
entities).

**Boost a room automatically when its humidity spikes** (e.g. a shower):

```yaml
alias: "Boost bathroom when humidity is high"
triggers:
  - trigger: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.healthbox_3_0_bathroom_humidity
    above: 70
actions:
  - action: fan.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: fan.healthbox_3_0_bathroom_boost
    data:
      percentage: 100
      preset_mode: "30 min"
```

**Boost every room at once when the whole-house air quality index gets
bad** - a real use for `Boost all`'s single shared level/duration rather
than triggering each room separately:

```yaml
alias: "Boost all rooms on poor whole-house air quality"
triggers:
  - trigger: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.healthbox_3_0_air_quality_index
    above: 60
actions:
  - action: fan.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: fan.healthbox_3_0_boost_all
    data:
      percentage: 75
      preset_mode: "1 hour"
```

**Switch a room's ventilation profile by time of day** (requires an
active API key, since profile control needs one - see
[Getting an API key](#getting-an-api-key-optional-but-recommended)):

```yaml
alias: "Bedroom profile: health by day, eco overnight"
triggers:
  - trigger: time
    at: "07:00:00"
  - trigger: time
    at: "22:00:00"
actions:
  - action: select.select_option
    target:
      entity_id: select.healthbox_3_0_bedroom_profile
    data:
      option: "{{ 'health' if trigger.now.hour == 7 else 'eco' }}"
```

## Data updates

The integration polls the device every 30 seconds via a
`DataUpdateCoordinator`: `/v2/api/data/current` if an API key is active,
otherwise `/v1/api/data/current`. Boost status is fetched per room on the
same cycle (it's a separate endpoint from the main data call). If the
device goes offline, affected entities go unavailable cleanly and recover
automatically once it's reachable again - no restart required.

## Known limitations

- **Automatic network discovery is unreliable on some networks.** Setup
  tries a UDP broadcast first, but delivery is commonly blocked by AP
  client isolation, IGMP snooping, or VLAN segmentation - it didn't work at
  all on the author's own network during development. When that happens,
  setup falls through to manual IP entry with no error shown; this is
  expected, not a bug.
- **Automatic reconnection's active network search only applies once an
  entry has connected successfully at least once.** If your Healthbox 3's
  IP is already wrong the very first time you set up the integration,
  there's no running coordinator yet to notice a failure and go looking
  for it. Home Assistant's own passive DHCP discovery can still trigger a
  reconnect independently of that (see
  [Changing the IP address or API key later](#changing-the-ip-address-or-api-key-later)),
  but it depends on Home Assistant actually observing a matching DHCP
  lease event, which isn't instant or guaranteed - use Reconfigure or fix
  the address and retry setup instead if you'd rather not wait.
- **Without an API key**, only basic room/valve data and boost control are
  available - no temperature/humidity/CO2/VOC/air-quality/ventilation-level
  sensors, no ventilation profile control, and none of the demand
  control/minimum ventilation/Breeze/CO2 threshold/silent schedule
  entities. This is a limitation of the device's v1 API, not of this
  integration.
- **API keys expire** after a multi-year period set by Renson, with no way
  for the device (or this integration) to detect the expiry date in
  advance. See [Getting an API key](#getting-an-api-key-optional-but-recommended)
  above.
- **The silent schedule's start/stop times apply to every day of the week
  identically - there is no per-day schedule.** The device's API does
  support a genuinely different start/stop pair for each weekday (this is
  what Renson's own app lets you configure), but this integration only
  ever reads and writes a single shared pair, matching how the app
  presents the common case. If you already have different per-day times
  set via the app, changing the `Silent start time` or `Silent stop time`
  entity **once** in Home Assistant overwrites all seven days to match
  that one shared pair - your existing per-day customization is not
  preserved. If you rely on different silent hours per day, don't use
  these two time entities.
- **Device-reported errors can't be cleared from Home Assistant.** The
  device only exposes a bulk "clear everything" action, with no way to
  acknowledge a single error - wiring that up to a repair issue's "Fix"
  button would risk dismissing unrelated errors alongside the one you
  meant to act on. Use the Renson app or the device itself to acknowledge
  or resolve an error; the repair issue and the `Device errors` sensor
  both disappear/update automatically once the device stops reporting it,
  no Home Assistant-side action needed either way.
- **The error `category` shown alongside a device error's code/description
  is best-effort, not confirmed against a real device.** It's derived
  from a code-prefix table sourced from Renson's public help-center/FAQ
  error index, a separate source from the device's own local API - real
  device errors have never actually been observed (`/v1/error` has only
  ever returned empty), so this mapping hasn't been cross-checked against
  a real populated response. Treat the category as a helpful hint, not a
  guarantee; the raw code and description are always shown alongside it.
- **The AQI `qualification` band (and the `AQI level` sensors showing that
  same band as their state) isn't necessarily comparable across rooms, or
  between a room and the whole-house value.** Per Renson's own guidance,
  each air quality index is built from whatever sensors that particular
  room has, so two rooms with different sensor types aren't strictly 1:1
  comparable even at the same numeric value. The whole-house AQI sensor is
  a separate aggregation, not necessarily equal to the value of whichever
  room its `main_pollutant`/`room` attributes currently point at - those
  only indicate the current greatest influence, not equality.

## Troubleshooting

**Setup fails with "Failed to connect to the device."** Confirm the IP is
reachable from Home Assistant (not just from your phone/laptop - a VLAN or
firewall rule can block one but not the other), and that nothing else
(e.g. the Renson app open elsewhere) is blocking the connection. This
integration only talks over your local network; it never needs internet
access to the device itself.

**Setup or Reconfigure fails with "The API key was rejected."** Double
check the key against the device's serial and warranty number (both
retrievable via `curl http://<device-ip>/v1/api/data/current` - see
[Getting an API key](#getting-an-api-key-optional-but-recommended)). If it
was working before and suddenly isn't, see the expiry note above - keys
aren't renewable in place, you'd need a new one from Renson.

**A room's CO2 sensor shows "unavailable."** Confirmed on real hardware:
some CO2 sensors report an empty reading (not zero, genuinely no data)
until they've warmed up after a device restart. This shows as
`unavailable`, not a stale/wrong value, and should resolve on its own once
the sensor starts reporting.

**A boost fan's `remaining` attribute jumped back up after I only changed
the level or duration.** Not a bug - confirmed on real hardware, changing
a boost's percentage or preset while it's already running restarts its
countdown from the new full duration rather than adjusting smoothly in
place. See [Boost control](#boost-control) for the full explanation.

**Settings > Repairs shows a "Healthbox reported a ... error" issue.** This
is the device itself reporting a fault (e.g. a sensor problem), surfaced
as-is - not something this integration detected or can diagnose further.
See [Known limitations](#known-limitations) above for why it can't be
cleared from Home Assistant.

**Entities disappeared after previously working** (any entity that
requires an active API key - see [Known limitations](#known-limitations)
for the full list: sensors beyond basic room/valve data, ventilation
profile control, and the demand control/minimum ventilation/Breeze/CO2
threshold/silent schedule entities). Check Settings → Devices & Services
for a "reauthenticate" prompt on this integration - this is the expected
result of an API key expiring or being revoked, not an error. Boost
control keeps working in the meantime; reauthenticating with a new key
restores the rest.

## Translations

English, Dutch, French, and German are available (Renson is a Belgian
manufacturer). They are not equally trustworthy, and the difference is
worth knowing before you rely on a label:

- **Dutch** has been reviewed by a native speaker.
- **French** has not, but its vocabulary has been checked against the
  wording of Renson's own French app - the terms a user already reads on
  their phone. The parts with no counterpart in the app stay best-effort.
- **German** is best-effort throughout and **has not been checked against
  Renson's German app**, which was not available: it uses standard German
  ventilation terminology rather than Renson's own words. Treat every
  label in it as a candidate for correction.

Corrections are very welcome via PR.

## Development

Tests use
[pytest-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component)
and real JSON fixtures captured from a physical device (see
`docs/fixtures/`):

```
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest
```

This integration satisfies every Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum rule of the
Home Assistant [Integration Quality
Scale](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/)
that applies to a custom (non-core) integration - the two mechanisms
core itself uses to verify a subset of these (`.strict-typing`, the
`brands` repository) have no equivalent for custom integrations, so this
is self-assessed rather than centrally verified. See
`custom_components/healthbox3/quality_scale.yaml` for the rule-by-rule
reasoning, including type-checking enforced in CI (see the mypy badge
above).
