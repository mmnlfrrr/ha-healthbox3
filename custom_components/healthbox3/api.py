    `program_enabled` is the raw `program.enable` field, deliberately
    named after it rather than "demand_control_enabled": confirmed on
    real hardware that this field tracks whether the clock/schedule
    fallback program is active, the *opposite* concept from "demand
    control is active" - a fresh `/v1/decision` fetch showed
    `program.enable: false` while the Renson app displayed demand control

    worth the risk of writing to fields the vendor deliberately doesn't
    expose to end users, for a feature nobody asked for.

    A further reason `profile`'s index is never parsed: its indexing
    convention has already changed between firmware versions once -
    firmware 1.11.1 was 1-indexed (the web UI's own JS converted to/from
    a 0-indexed dropdown), firmware 2.6.9 is 0-indexed with no conversion
    at all. If this index were ever parsed, a future OS/App update could
    silently flip that convention again with no error - just a wrong

        is literally `"firmware version"` (with a space) on this endpoint -
        confirmed from a real capture - not `"Firmwareversion"` like the
        unrelated discovery response uses for the same concept.
